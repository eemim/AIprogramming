### Homework for AI Programming course

Not all scripts are entirely my creation (e.g., some visual representations and parts of the code were provided as a base), but this repository represents the methods and libraries used in the AI Programming course.

*Note that only the code is included in this repository. Datasets and other materials are not included.*
